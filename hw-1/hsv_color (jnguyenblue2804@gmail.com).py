group numbers into k clustesr
pick k points randomly in the data/image
set these k points as cluster

loop through every data point in data 
calculate distance to each cluster
find minimum cluster and assign to datapoint to that cluster

calculate new center of k clusters by finding new average from distances of points assigned to cluster
stop when k cluster value converges to desired value

plot cluster points
